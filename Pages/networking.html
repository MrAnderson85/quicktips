    <h2 style="text-align:center">Terminology</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center">First, let's go over a few terms that are used in networking:<br></p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>
          IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)<br>
          Each machine that connects to a network will be given one by the device that is creating the network(modem or router).<br>
          it will look like this: <b>192.168.x.x</b><br>
          <note>
            The numbering system used here is binary, with the decimal values of each section shown. Values range from 0 to 255, more on Binary Numbering in the Computer Numbering Systems section.
          </note>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>
          MAC Address (Media Access Controller Address)<br>
          Each network interface will have one that is unique to that piece of technology.<br>
          It looks like <b>AB:12:CD:34:EF:56</b><br>
          <note>The numbering used here is called Hexadecimal. Which means that numbers 0-9 are used as well as letters A-F.<b> ie: 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-A-B-C-D-E-F</b><br>
            For more information on Hexadecimal numbering...see Computer Numbering Systems

	  <h2>Modem vs Router </h2>
    <p>The following will outline the differences between devices:</p>
    <h4>Wireless Modem</h4>
    <p>
      These devices are what the customer will receive when they get a service from their provider. They have a lot of benefits for customers that only have a few devices.
      <br>Let's get technical: Whether its cable or DSL(Digital Subscriber Line..ie Bell or Teksavvy), the job of a modem does not change, the device will extract the internet data from the incoming data connection. This is done by looking at a particular frequency, usually around 1MHz on the line and separating it from the other signals and passing it through to a Network Module. The Network Module will then pass the signal to the proper components to deliver the signal to the user or devices.
    </p>

    <h4>Wireless Router</h4>
    <p>
      A Router is a device that will create a network that your devices can connect to and when connecting a modem to your Router, your devices can access the internet aswell. Routers have the benefit of being able to handle a lot of connections at once, meaning that there can be multiple devices attached to a single router. These devices are designed to offer greater ranges and signal strength.
    </p>

    <h4>What is a Switch?</h4>
    <p>
      A switch is a device that expands the wired portion of you network. The device itself contains a couple of ports to which other devices can connect using. A wireless modem and a router both have a mini switch hardwired inside of them, this gives the ablilty to connect up to 4, sometimes up to 8, devices directly to the modem or router.Switches are rarely used in households, and are more promiment in business environments.
    </p>

    <h5>So what's the difference???</h5>
    <p>
      The main difference between a Wireless Modem and a Router is that the Wireless Modem can only handle a small number of devices.<br>
      Another difference is the power of a Router over a Wireless Modem. Wireless Modems are designed for small places, like apartments or single person dwellings, as they can only have a limited range. Whereas Routers can have greater ranges and reach further, giving the customer the ability to connect devices from multiple rooms.
    </p>

    <h4>Why both? or will one be enough?</h4>
    <p>
      This question is hard to answer confidently as there are many variables. If there are a lot of devices that need to be connected, the Wireless Modem may not be powerful enough to handle the number of connections and therefore adding the Router would be a benefit.<br>
      With the ever-changing field of technology, the wireless Modems are getting better year after year. It would be safe to assume that the Wireless Modem should be sufficient enough for most residences. However, with the recent explosion in Smart enabled devices, a Router is almost necessary to handle the vast amounts of connected devices in the house today.
    </p>

    <h5>Issues?</h5>
    <p>
      When too many devices are connected to the Network, it could cause the device that creates the network to fail and freeze up,  or "crash". To rectify this issue the wireless creation device being used needs to be upgraded. Either a new Router is needed to be installed in place of the old existing one or a Router needs to be inserted between the devices and the modem.
    </p>

    <h4>Cables</h4>
    <p>
      There are a few <b><i>"types"</b></i> of cables used today, but really only one that is used perdominantly in the house.
      <br><br>
       
      <h5>Cat 5e</h5>
      
      <br><h5>Cat 6</h5>
